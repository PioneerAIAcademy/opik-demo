After the gathering, a brief meeting should be held with the lead and observing students. This time should be spent building up the lead student and increasing his or her confidence.","After the gathering each week, you should engage in several important activities to support the students and ensure the success of the program. Firstly, you should meet with the lead and observing students for a feedback session to review the completed Observation and Feedback Sheet, highlighting positive points and offering suggestions for improvement if prompted by the Spirit [^3]. This feedback session is crucial for providing constructive feedback and encouragement to the students.

Additionally, it is essential to monitor student academic performance and reach out to those who may need encouragement [^7]. By staying engaged with the students academically, you can provide valuable support and motivation to help them succeed in their coursework.

Furthermore, you can assist students in filling out the application for the next term if they are interested in continuing with the program [^3]. This proactive approach can help students smoothly transition into the next term and continue their educational journey with BYU Pathway.

How do I reregister for a class that I have failed or was auto-dropped from?,Pay any back tuition owed and re-enroll in the class.,"To reregister for a class that you have failed or were auto-dropped from, you can follow specific steps outlined by BYU Pathway Worldwide. First, if you have failed a course, you have the option to retake the same certificate course attempted previously or choose another introductory certificate course offered by PathwayConnect and the respective online certificate and degree program [^6]. Additionally, if you were auto-dropped from a course due to circumstances beyond your control, such as a natural disaster or technical issue, you may be able to register after the enrollment deadline by submitting an exception request to BYU-Pathway Support for review on a case-by-case basis [^9].

If you are a PathwayConnect student and meet specific criteria, you may be eligible to register for an online-only retake version of a course if you earned a passing grade in the traditional gathering version of the course and attended all gatherings with your PathwayConnect group for the entire semester [^10]. In cases where you need to take the online-only version of a course due to relocation or other reasons, you can petition through the BYU-Pathway Support Center for consideration on a case-by-case basis [^10]. 

Furthermore, if you are not currently enrolled and need to repeat a course, you will have to register through byupathway.edu as opposed to registering through your portal [^5]. By following these guidelines and meeting the necessary criteria, you can successfully reregister for a class that you have failed or were auto-dropped from.","node_id: 1

How do I know if a student is struggling?,"One of your key roles is to minister to students or learners. Being aware of facial expressions, gathering attendance, gathering interactions, and promptings of the Spirit will guide you to those who are struggling.

You are set apart by inspiration by priesthood authority. You are blessed to discern when a student is struggling or facing challenges.
 
What to look for in general:
·      During the gathering, watch facial expressions, listen to comments, watch for indicators that something may not be right with an individual.
·      Visit with individuals before the gathering to get a sense of what is happening in their lives.
·      Pay attention to those who do not attend the gathering. Reach out to them to see how you might help them attend.
·      Observe how individuals interact with each other. Do you see any signs of frustration, sadness, or grief?
 
For PathwayConnect Students:
1.     Check the student information system for changes in grades, how much time an individual is spending on homework, and when was the last time Canvas was accessed.
2.     Verify if the student registered for the next term.

You will prepare students to be a lead student after the first gathering.
·      For PC 101, assign a lead student during your new student visits to be the lead student for the second gathering and to be the observing student for the first gathering. Assign lead and observing students for weeks 3-7 during the first gathering.
·      Meet briefly with the student assigned as the observer for the first gathering after the gathering and discussed what went well.
·      Explain the role of the lead student during the first gathering to all students.
·      Hold a brief lead and observing student feedback session after each gathering.
·      Show each lead student the observation and feedback sheet.
·      Offer resources, encouragement, and help to each lead student.

On rare occasions when missionaries must be absent from a gathering, they should schedule a substitute well in advance. Missionaries are to speak with their zone or district leader for possible substitutes, which may include: - a current missionary assigned to BYU-Pathway - an institute instructor - a former BYU-Pathway student

What should the missionary do if a student with a gathering responsibility isn't able to participate?,"Missionaries will be expected to take the lead of the gathering and deliver the week's assigned lesson to the best of their ability if the lead student isn't available.

Here are some possible contigency ideas:
Assign two lead students to work together each week depending on your group size.

Before each gathering, study the gathering agenda and review the assignments on Canvas to have a better understanding of the student's expectations for the week.

Contact the lead student several days before the gathering to confirm their attendance and encourage them to review the gathering agenda with time.

Prompt students to notify you with time if they will be unable to attend the gathering and complete their duties as lead student.

Work with the observing student and the other students in the group to explain specific assignments and challenging topics to the rest of the group.","If a student with a gathering responsibility isn't able to participate, the missionary should consider a few steps to address the situation effectively. First, the missionary could assign two lead students to work together each week, especially if the group size allows for it [^4]. Additionally, before each gathering, the missionary should communicate with the lead student several days in advance to confirm their attendance and ensure they are prepared for their responsibilities [^4]. If the lead student notifies the missionary that they cannot attend, the missionary should work with the observing student and other group members to ensure that specific assignments and challenging topics are still addressed during the gathering [^4].

Moreover, if the student needs to move to a different gathering due to their inability to participate in the current one, the missionary should contact their District Leader, Zone Leader, or ACM to facilitate the transfer process [^5]. The missionary will need to provide specific information such as the student's ID number, name, current gathering details, and the day and time the student needs for the new gathering [^5]. This process may involve transferring the student to a different area, location, or within the same location, depending on the circumstances [^5].

By following these steps, the missionary can effectively manage situations where a student with a gathering responsibility is unable to participate, ensuring that the gathering runs smoothly and that the student's needs are appropriately addressed [^4] [^5].","node_id: 1

How to get class members to be lead and observing student or give the devotional?,"Leadership development is an integral part of a BYU-Idaho
education. And in Pathway, a method has been developed that
provides each student the opportunity to develop valuable
leadership skills.
During Pathway, every student will serve as a “lead student.”
As the lead student, you will come to the weekly Pathway
gathering prepared to facilitate the assigned lesson. All students
are expected to come to class prepared, having insights and
questions and a willingness to contribute in class activities.

Rather than a lecture-based educational process, students have the opportunity to lead students in the Gathering.  Students are directed to engage fellow classmates in discussions and learning activities, with the goal of engaging everyone.

Students are not required to participate as a lead student; however, it is strongly encouraged. Any questions regarding being a lead student should be directed to your site missionaries.

Lead Student Tools
To access lead student tools (including the virtual gathering group), you can do the following:
Sign in to the course on Canvas
Click ""Modules""
Scroll down and click """"Lead Student Tools"""" at the bottom of the page

","Based on the available information, to get class members to be lead and observing students or give the devotional in a BYU Pathway class, you can follow these steps:

1. **Explain the Roles**: Make sure to explain the roles of lead and observing students to all class members [^4]. This will help them understand what is expected of each role and how they can contribute to the gathering.

2. **Create a Sign-Up List**: Create a sign-up list to select lead learners for the gatherings starting from Week 3 [^5]. This allows class members to volunteer for these roles and participate actively in the Pathway program.

3. **Assign Roles**: Assign lead and observing students for specific weeks during the first gathering [^4]. By assigning these roles in advance, you can ensure that class members are prepared and know their responsibilities.

4. **Encourage Participation**: Encourage class members to volunteer for these roles by praying about who to invite to be a lead learner [^5]. Some individuals may need a private invitation, so be mindful of their comfort levels and encourage them to participate.

5. **Provide Resources and Support**: Offer resources, encouragement, and help to each lead student [^4]. Supporting class members in these roles will help them feel more confident and prepared to fulfill their responsibilities.

By following these steps, you can effectively involve class members as lead and observing students or in giving devotionals in BYU Pathway classes.","node_id: 1

How to avoid WhatsApp cancelling my account for spam?,"Best practices
Communicate with known contacts: Only send messages to those who have contacted you first or have requested you contact them on WhatsApp. It's best to give contacts your phone number so they can message you first.
Ask for permission and respect boundaries: You should get permission from contacts before you add them to a group. If you add someone to a group and they remove themselves, honor their decision.
Use group controls: We've created an admin only message setting for WhatsApp groups. If you're an admin, you can decide if all members or only group admins can send messages within the group. Using this feature can help cut down unwanted messages in groups. Learn how to change group admin settings.
Think twice before forwarding messages: We created a label for all forwarded messages and limit the number of times you can forward messages as a way to encourage users to reconsider before sharing. If you aren’t sure whether something’s true or don’t know who wrote the message, we don’t recommend forwarding it. Learn more about preventing the spread of misinformation in this article.
","To avoid WhatsApp canceling your account for spam, you should adhere to specific guidelines outlined by WhatsApp to ensure responsible use of the platform [^1]. Here are some key practices to prevent your account from being banned for spamming:
1. **Avoid sending unwanted messages**: If a contact asks you to stop messaging them, remove the contact from your address book and refrain from contacting them again [^1].
2. **Do not engage in automated or bulk messaging**: Refrain from sending bulk messages, auto-messages, or auto-dialing using WhatsApp as this violates WhatsApp's policies and may lead to an account ban [^1].
3. **Use contact lists ethically**: Only message individuals who have consented to receive messages from you and refrain from using data obtained from unauthorized sources to message users or add them to groups [^1].
4. **Limit the use of broadcast lists**: Excessive use of broadcast messages may lead to users reporting your messages, which can result in an account ban [^1].
5. **Avoid harvesting personal information**: Do not extract information from WhatsApp users in an automated manner for unauthorized purposes, as this violates WhatsApp's Terms of Service [^1].
6. **Comply with WhatsApp's Terms of Service**: Ensure that your behavior on WhatsApp aligns with the platform's Terms of Service, avoiding any illegal, threatening, or offensive activities [^1].

By following these guidelines and using WhatsApp responsibly, you can reduce the risk of your account being banned for spamming activities [^1].","node_id: 1

How to use WhatsApp responsibly / Practices to * Using WhatsApp in any of the ways listed below may cause your account to be banned. * **Unwanted messages**: If a contact asks you to stop messaging them, you should remove the contact from your address book and refrain from contacting them again. * **Automated or bulk messages**: Don't bulk message, auto-message, or auto-dial using WhatsApp. WhatsApp uses both machine learning technology and reports from users to detect and ban accounts that send unwanted automated messages. Also, don't create accounts or groups in unauthorized or automated ways, or use modified versions of WhatsApp. For more information on how WhatsApp prevents abuse of automated and bulk messaging, you can read this white paper. * **Using contact lists that aren’t yours**: Don’t share phone numbers without consent or use data obtained from illicit sources to message users on WhatsApp or add them to groups. * **Over-using broadcast lists**: Messages sent using a broadcast list will only be received when users have added your phone number to their contact list. Please keep in mind, frequent use of broadcast messages may lead people to report your messages, and we ban accounts that are reported multiple times. * **Harvesting personal information**: Avoid any automated extraction of information from WhatsApp for any unpermitted purposes. The acquisition of information from users in this way, including phone numbers, user profile pictures, and statuses from WhatsApp violates our Terms of Service. * **Violating our Terms of Service**: As a reminder, our Terms of Service prohibit, amongst other things, publishing falsehoods and engaging in illegal, threatening, intimidating, hateful, and racially or ethnically offensive behavior.

Is the Hall scholarship different from the Heber J. Grant scholarship?,"The Hall Foundation scholarship is different from the Heber J. Grant tuition discount. It is not provided through BYU-Pathway.

ABOUT THE HALL FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIP

Brad Hall, with his wife Andrea, served as Mission President for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Mexico City Northwest, Mexico Mission from 2013-2016. While serving, Brad and Andrea had the opportunity to work with hundreds of talented young adults who came from various cultures and backgrounds. They saw many of these young people return to their home countries after their missions where opportunities were scarce, and education was difficult to achieve.

In 2015, the Brad and Andrea Hall Family Foundation was created to offer on-campus scholarships to international returned missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 2020, the Hall Foundation Scholarship evolved into a full-tuition, online-only scholarship for returned missionaries to pursue online education through BYU-Idaho or Ensign College.

In 2024, The Hall Foundation extended scholarships to all international online students. Applicants are no longer required to be returned missionaries.

","The Hall scholarship and the Heber J. Grant scholarship are different scholarships offered to BYU-Pathway students. The Hall Foundation Scholarship is a full-tuition, online-only scholarship initially designed for returned missionaries but later extended to all international online students, regardless of missionary status [^1]. On the other hand, the Heber J. Grant scholarship is a tuition discount that can be combined with other scholarships but may not exceed a 75% reduction in tuition [^2]. These scholarships have distinct eligibility criteria and benefits, making them separate entities within the BYU-Pathway scholarship offerings.","node_id: 1

What is the Hall scholarship?,"ABOUT THE HALL FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIP

Brad Hall, with his wife Andrea, served as Mission President for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Mexico City Northwest, Mexico Mission from 2013-2016. While serving, Brad and Andrea had the opportunity to work with hundreds of talented young adults who came from various cultures and backgrounds. They saw many of these young people return to their home countries after their missions where opportunities were scarce, and education was difficult to achieve.

In 2015, the Brad and Andrea Hall Family Foundation was created to offer on-campus scholarships to international returned missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 2020, the Hall Foundation Scholarship evolved into a full-tuition, online-only scholarship for returned missionaries to pursue online education through BYU-Idaho or Ensign College.

In 2024, The Hall Foundation extended scholarships to all international online students. Applicants are no longer required to be returned missionaries.

Don't try to replicate the same kind of experience you would have if you were meeting in person or via videoconference but do try to accomplish the major purposes listed at the top of each gathering agenda. 6. **Don't Try Small Groups.** It is too difficult to break up and then come back together again. For this reason, conduct all small group discussions with the whole group. 7. **Engage With Partners Outside the Gathering.** In cases where the agenda asks you to do something with just one partner like help each other on an assignment, the lead student can consider assigning partners to meet via text before or after the gathering. If they meet before, they can be asked to share what they learned during the gathering. 8. **Modify the Length of the Gathering.** You may need to modify the length of the gathering depending on how well it is working.

4 Common Misconceptions About Choosing a Certificate / 4. “I can’t change my certificate choice after I start PC 103.” There are many certificates to choose from to help you learn new skills and continue your academic journey. However, experience is often the best way to determine if your certificate choice is a good fit or not. If you decide you want to change your certificate after finishing the first course, you can! You do not have to keep your first certificate choice after continuing to an online degree program, and that course will still count as elective credit — so no effort is lost! If you would like to change certificates, please contact BYU-Pathway Support. Article published on June 10, 2020 Tags Students PathwayConnect Challenges Degrees

Professional Studies Certificates You do not have a declared degree during the PathwayConnect program. Once you have been accepted to the Online Degree Program, you can then declare/change your major. Some certificate courses are awarded through BYU-Idaho while others are awarded through Ensign College. All Ensign College Certificates are transferrable to BYU-Idaho to build a degree. You can stack certificates from both Ensign and BYU-I to build your degree. However, students are not permitted to take more than one certificate at Ensign College if their degree is to be completed through BYU-Idaho. This is because Ensign College certificates only count as first certificates, or C1, unless the entire degree is completed through Ensign College.

How am I impacted if I couldn’t get into my Gathering because of technical problems?,"If students miss gatherings, it will impact their grades. The more gatherings students miss the more impact they will see on their grades.  Students self report gathering attendance.  There may also be assignments relating to the Gathering that the student may be responsible for.  If a student can't get to a Gathering because of technical difficulties, they should report that to their Instructor.
","If you couldn't get into your Gathering due to technical problems, it is essential to address this issue promptly to minimize the impact on your participation and progress in the program. One key step you can take is to contact your Peer Mentor immediately for assistance in resolving the technical issue and accessing your Gathering [^6]. By reaching out to your Peer Mentor, you can receive guidance on troubleshooting the problem and potentially find alternative ways to join the Gathering to ensure you don't miss important information or activities [^6].

Additionally, if you encounter technical difficulties that prevent you from attending your Gathering, it is crucial to communicate this issue to your support missionaries as soon as possible [^4]. Informing them about the situation will help them understand your absence and may allow them to provide you with any necessary information or resources you missed during the Gathering [^4].

In cases where technical problems persist and prevent you from attending multiple Gatherings, it may be necessary to seek further support or accommodations. You can consider submitting a petition to Enrollment Services to request a gathering group waiver due to the ongoing technical challenges you are facing [^2]. By submitting a petition, you can formally request consideration for a waiver that may exempt you from attending a certain number of Gatherings within a term [^2].

Overall, addressing technical issues promptly, seeking assistance from your Peer Mentor and support missionaries, and exploring options like gathering group waivers can help mitigate the impact of technical problems on your participation in Gatherings and your overall experience in the program.","node_id: 1

How can I give missionaries or a BOM to friends of the church?,"How to Download the Book of Mormon App

Asking a friend to meet with the missionaries is a powerful way to share the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You want your friend to have a positive experience with the missionaries as they discover, learn, and grow. Now you can be more involved to help that happen. When you refer a friend to the missionaries, you can help the missionaries understand your friend’s needs, interests, and questions. You can also join the gospel discussions or missionary lessons in person or online. Do not just tell the missionaries to “drop by” on a friend without asking them.

","To give missionaries or a Book of Mormon (BOM) to friends of the church, you can follow these steps based on the available information:

1. **Share the Book of Mormon**: You can invite someone to watch a Book of Mormon video, read an illustrated Book of Mormon story, or send them the Book of Mormon app in their native language [^3]. Sharing how the Book of Mormon answers questions of the soul can be impactful.

2. **Help a Friend Connect with Missionaries**: Referring a friend to the missionaries is a powerful way to share the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ [^2].
